### Introduction

---

Currently, there are a lot of apps that can easily charge money from you. Like Amazon, you clicked few buttons and place orders in no time. However, certain workflows are designed for customers to spend money. We can build a certain application to help customers rethink if one purchase is reasonable or not before you place the orders. This app can monitor the payment activity on the webpage or in a certain app.

### Value

---

We can present users the spending comparison before and after they used the application. The same amount of money can then be put into the investment, education which yield more value to the users. We can apply some formula and say `If you rethink your current spending now, this amount of money can be $X in 10 years.`  

### Implementation

---

1. On the web page, it might be easier since it should be easier to monitor payment activity through the browser. Then we can provide a pop-up window before users clicking the place order button with additional information 
    - Personal budget set in the application.
    - Some message to let the user confirm if they really need to buy the staff.
    - Hints that can help them better allocate the money like improving themselves, making an investment which can generate returns.
2. On the mobile side, it may request more technical skills, since you probably need to monitor different applications which trigger a payment action.

### Additional thoughts

---

That made me have a more generic thought, with the improvement of technology, people's life is getting much `easier` and `convenient`. You can buy things by clicking a few buttons on the screen and you will get them in a couple of days or even hours. At the same time, we also lose something like the actual shopping experience or too easy to spend more money. The reverse of certain trends can be a new opportunity like the above idea.
